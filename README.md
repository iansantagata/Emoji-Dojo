# Emoji Dojo

This repository is meant to be a storage space for scripts relevant to manipulating small images (aka emojis) in some way.

Here are some examples:

- Want to take an image like this 8-ball 🎱 and make it move to look like it's being shaken?  Try `intensify.sh`!
- Want to take an image like this dizzy face 😵 and make it rotate in a circle?  Try `rotate.sh`!
- Want to take an image like this heart ❤️ and make it shimmer through all colors of the rainbow?  Try `partify.sh`!

If there is something missing here that you think could be used, feel free to add an issue or a pull request!
