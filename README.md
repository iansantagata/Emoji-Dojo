# Emoji Dojo

This repository is meant to be a storage space for scripts relevant to manipulating small images (aka emojis) in some way.

Here are some examples:

- Want to take an image like this 8-ball 🎱 and make it move to look like it's being shaken?  Try [intensify.sh](scripts/intensify.sh)!
- Want to take an image like this dizzy face 😵 and make it spin in a circle?  Try [spin.sh](scripts/spin.sh)!
- Want to take an image like this heart ❤️ and make it shimmer through all colors of the rainbow?  Try [partify.sh](scripts/partify.sh)!
- Want to convert your image file from a `.jpg` to a `.png`?  Try [convert.sh](scripts/convert.sh)!

If there is something missing here that you think could be used, feel free to add an issue or a pull request!

## Dependencies

The scripts in this repository require [Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/) to function properly and are meant to be run using your shell (bash, zsh, etc).
